# Project Two 

## Project Overview
This project is a heartfelt tribute to my homeland, Yemen, through the song My Beloved by Hussain Al Jassmi. It expresses my deep love for my country, the sense of community I share with fellow Yemenis, and the resilience that keeps us connected. Community is not just about being in the same place—it’s about shared struggles, love, and holding onto our culture and identity no matter what. Even in distance, we find ways to stay connected, whether through music, language, or memories passed down through generations.

With this project, I want to bring the song’s emotions to life—its love, nostalgia, and devotion to Yemen. By creating an interactive version of My Beloved, I hope to make an experience that others who love their homeland can relate to.
## Technical Overview
The project will be built using HTML and CSS 

Transitions & Transformations: CSS animations will be used to create smooth text reveals, slow fades, and symbolic movements to reflect the emotional weight of the lyrics. Once the word Yemen shows up it will transtion to a lighter color background to symoblize hope. 
Software & Hosting: The project will be coded in VS Code and hosted on GitHub Pages.
